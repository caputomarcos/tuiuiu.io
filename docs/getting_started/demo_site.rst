Demo site
=========


To create a new site on Tuiuiu we recommend the ``tuiuiu start`` command in :doc:`index`, however a demo site exists containing example page types and models. We also recommend you use the demo site for testing during development of Tuiuiu itself.

The repo and installation instructions can be found here: `https://github.com/tuiuiu/tuiuiudemo <https://github.com/tuiuiu/tuiuiudemo>`_
